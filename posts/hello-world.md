# Hello World

Welcome to my blog for Linux System Development and compilation with **Gtk4** as statically linked runtime.

We want to create simple portable Linux applications that don’t require installation of the newest Gtk4 version.

Example screenshots:

Why do we make statically linked Gtk4 into portable linux applications because we won't get stress for required installations like "Oh no, your Gtk4 Runtime is too old." That is why it is really bad if you already develop with very latest version of Gtk4 runtime that is why It is very important to pack into binary - we don't need to worry about statically linked. Enjoy your portable linux applications.

PS: some warning libEGL was accidently by Dotnet 10.x if you use Clang/GCC into binary = It doesn't see warnings :)
