Sorry, DeafMan1983 has right to limit against your location.
Long history: Some bad people harassed my deafness since I played on Star Treak : Fleet Commend and I wanted to move to Asian server but I never call bad who is Jessica? I don't understand why do they say bad me but they have disabled my communication. How do I tell everyone. But I amd eaf. I come from Germany and I don't allow bad people from Australia and New Zeeland because they think I am Jessica. That is why I won't allow everyone. You are forbidden. Half-Life Mapping I want to help discard but Shepard harassed me "Fuck off..." and removed me from discord. But I tried to explain TWHL page but Urby writes commoly. "You will get banned, fine." I don't understand for nothing. I write explain but next day I don't see I want read who has forbidden my account. "You have been banned" I don't understand I tried to explain explain but Urby ignored my deafness. But I don't accept this apology of Urby - I tried to explain explain. but they are crazy because he is younger than me. It is not right to forbid me. I am right to explain but he is really stupid to me. That is why . I never contact him because he scammed me. But I lose friends from Bosnia and Indonesia :( That is why Urby is bad king. I never evade again.

Because they don't know my deafness. That is why I rush back against bad people. No joke! I am serious mad because you are always kidding me. Thank you for everything.
Do not call me about "banned" - I don't know and "ban", "banned" are unclear for me. Please call me "forbid", "forbade" and "forbidden". 
Whatever - please be carefully! Thanks!
